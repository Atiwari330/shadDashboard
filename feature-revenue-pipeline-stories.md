## üìù Notes for AI Builder

1. **Start Here**: Always begin with STORY-001 to understand the codebase
2. **Reuse Components**: Prioritize existing UI components over creating new ones
3. **Follow Patterns**: Match the coding style seen in `bar-graph.tsx` and other chart components
4. **Check Progress**: After completing each story, mark its checkbox with an 'x'
5. **Request Review**: At each checkpoint, explicitly ask for human review before proceeding
6. **Mock Data**: Keep mock data realistic but varied to show different scenarios

Remember: This is a demo version. Focus on visual impact and smooth interactions rather than complex data handling.
